% LANGUAGE VARIABLES
% be able to switch the language easyle, we define variables in
% different language files.
% If the language is ngerman we load the appropriate file:
\iflanguage{ngerman}{
   \input{content-variables-ngerman}
}{}
% However we load the english variable in every case to
% be sure to have them defined even in unkown languages:
\input{content-variables-english}
% inside of this file we use \providecommand to define the
% variables so we don't overwrite the defined variables
% of other languages. \providecommand is "ignored" if
% the macor is already defined.
